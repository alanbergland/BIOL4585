# Retrieving data in the command-line

## Overview
Many research projects involve using publicly available data. But, that data has to be transferred from its source (hosted on some server somewhere) to your personal directory (on Rivanna). Here, you will be retrieving publicly available data published with the **1000 Genomes Project**.

During this activity, you will practice:
  * Accessing an online file system, in this case one that hosts **1000 Genomes Project** data
  * Downloading compressed data to your directory via the command-line
  * Decompressing files (such that we can then process the files)
  * Investigating the structure and contents of a file with command-line tools

## Part 1

What type of file is it / what does the file contain?
How many lines are in it?
How many rows are in it?
How big is it (in terms of disk use)?

## Part 2
